<h1>Intuit India Summer Internship 2021 Hiring Experience</h1>
<aside>18 June 2021.</aside>

</header>
<article>
  The drive was annouced in December 2020 and the process started with resume shortlisting in January 2021. 
  Around 60 profiles were selected among ~250 applying candidates. The shortlisting criteria was not immediately clear, but presence of front-end or back-end web technologies in the resume might have helped as analysed later.
  <h3>Online Assessment</h3>
  It was a 90 minute online test with 4 problems problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms which you had to code in your preferred programming language. Platform was <em>Hackerrank</em>. The difficulty and description of the problems were as following:
  <ul> 
    <li>Easy: Some matrix manipulation</li>
    <li>Easy: Variation of Knapsack</li>
    <li>Easy-Medium: Involved Implementation and Optimisation </li>
    <li>Medium(?): Suppose at every node during a DFS in a connected, undirected and weighted graph (not just tree), rather than choosing any random child node and proceeding with DFS, you could only go the node having max weight next. You had to find the in-time for each node. Usual 10<sup>5</sup>ish constraints. </li>
  </ul>

  Each problem was worth 50 points, hence total 200 points.

  Me and one other guy who was selected had ~120 points.

  It is not clear how many people were selected after this step, but I think the selection criteria was somewhere between 75-80 points(not sure).

  The problems alone were not that tough, but the time limit was 90 minutes, which made the test somewhat challenging.

I got the mail for that they'll be scheduling an interview about 2 weeks later. 
The first round of the interviews was around 10 days after that in February 2021 IIRC.

<h3> First Round of Interviews </h3>

I was having my night's sleep on one fine afternoon when I recieved a mail around 12 Noon that my interview is scheduled at 3:00 PM the same day.

I woke up at 3:00 to have lunch and plans to go back to bed again when I read the mail. I was shit scared.
Then I mailed the <em>HR</em> to re-schedule the interview if possible, luckily they considered my request and re-scheduled it the same day in evening.


<br>
The interview was scheduled for only 30 minutes and I was pretty confused what will they ask in only 30 minutes. 
<br>
When I entered the zoom call there were 2 interviewers, they introduced them and then I proceeded with my introduction.

The first problem was as follows:
<br> <br> <br>
<em>You have been given a 2D array, some random location in it(the coordinates) and the address of the element at 0, 0 in memory. Find the address of elements at given coordinates.</em>
<br><br>
I solved it shortly but due to nervousness and lack of proper sleep, I couldn't initially remember what is the exact size of an integer in memory (4 or 8 bytes).
<br><br><br>

The second problem was a version of <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/">this popular problem</a>.

<br>
I cant exactly recall the problem, but it was pretty similar to this one. Just a little tweaked. <br>
I first proceeded to explain my approach, then they asked me to code it and ran it on a few test cases. It was a simple problem, hence there were no issues solving it.
<br><br>

Then they asked me a few questions related to one of my projects, backend related stuff. 
<br><br>

We had casual conversation for a few minutes then the interview ended.
<br><br>
<h3> Second Round of Interviews </h3>
<br>
Nothing was communicated to me when I heard another guy had 2 interviews the same day and has been offered an Internship which he posted about on LinkedIn. I was disheartened a bit that I didn't get selected for a second round.<br>
I went to college in March, that is when they mailed me that my second round of interview is scheduled after 5 days.<br>
<br>
Again there were 2 interviewers this time, one pretty experienced and the interview was scheduled to be of one hour. <br>
They started with their introduction and then I proceeded with mine like the last time.<br>
Then there was some discussion on one of my project, the same on which a small discussion happened last time. They asked about the system design techniques that I have used in my project and reason them. Also stuff like how did you design this feature etc.
<br>
Then they proceeded over problem solving section, there were supposed to be 2 questions, one by each interviewer, but coincidently they both came with the same question and prepared test cases and all for that one only. It was very similar to <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/">this famous problem</a>.
<br>
It was a little tweaked like last time, but that did increase the difficulty level by much.<br>
I explained my solution approach while they cross questionsed.<br>
Then they asked me to code it.
<br>
I decided to write the function that implements my logic first, so when I wrote <code>stack &lt;int&gt </code> they stopped me and asked me to code it from scratch. After I completed the logic for one part of the code (paranthesis, i.e. two remaining, curly braces and square brackets), they told me code is going to be messy if I am going to implement the other two brackets because of many <code>if/else</code> statements.
<br> They asked me if I can generalize my approach and write more readable code. Then I modified my function to make it more generalized and clean. <br>
There was constant cross questioning while I was writing code or explaning my approach<br>
After adding driver code they tested it on a few pre-populated test cases followed by custom one's which they provided on the spot. The code ran well and we moved to the next section.<br><br>

The next was of core subjects, they asked me if I know about deadlocks, semaphore, mutex, race conditions. All of those words all at once and I hadn't studied OS at all. 
<br>
So I told them that I'll to answer the questions though I do not remember them all.<br>
They gave me a problem related to deadlocks, I do not remember the problem but I do remember that I couldn't solve it on the spot, I explained my understanding of deadlocks and how they can be solved from what I knew. I remember thinking I messed up this section. They proceeded to next section which was DBMS.<br><br>
First question was what are ACID properties and explaining each part.<br>
Then they gave me a schema and asked me to write a <code>sql</code> query to extract some data.<br>
I wrote a nested query but they were interested in Joins, so they asked me if I knew of some another approach. Which led me to writing the query with Joins and they asked a lot of cross questions during this, like what are all the types of joins and their definitions and why did I use outer join and not left join etc.
<br>
For the next section they decided to come back to OS, they asked me a version of <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-larger-file-with-smaller-ram/">this problem</a>. The difference was the problem asked to me was of searching and the above problem is a sorting one. But the solution of both the problems is <em>Divide and Conquer</em><br>
After that maybe a few more questions that I dont remember.<br>
The interview ended with a casual chat.
<br>
<br>
Total 3 people were selected from the college.
<br>
<br>
> I think the online assessment was difficult relative to the interviews atleast in my case, because of the time limitations. So it was crucial to crack that, after that one with <em>clearish</em> basics could crack the interview.<br>
  It was also important to have a few projects in the bag.
  <br><br>
  <br>I'll be adding here in case I remember anything else. If there is an error in the above text, you can raise an issue <a href="https://github.com/0xutk/0xutk.github.io">here<a/>.<br>
Thank you.
