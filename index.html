<h1>Intuit India Summer Internship 2021 Hiring Experience</h1>
<aside>18 June 2021.</aside>
<br><br>
</header>
<article>
  The drive was annouced in December 2020 and the process started with resume shortlisting in January 2021. 
  Around 60 profiles were selected among ~250 applying candidates. The shortlisting criteria was not immediately clear, but presence of front-end or back-end web technologies in the resume might have helped as analysed later.
  <h3>Online Assessment</h3>
  It was a 90 minute online test with 4 problems problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms which you had to code in your preferred programming language. Platform was <em>Hackerrank</em>. The difficulty and description of the problems were as following:
  <ul> 
    <li>Easy: Some matrix manipulation</li>
    <li>Easy: Variation of Knapsack</li>
    <li>Easy-Medium: Involved Implementation and Optimisation </li>
    <li>Medium(?): Suppose at every node during a DFS in a connected, undirected and weighted graph (not just tree), rather than choosing any random child node and proceeding with DFS, you could only go the node having max weight next. You had to find the in-time for each node. Usual 10<sup>5</sup>ish constraints. </li>
  </ul>

  Each problem was worth 50 points, hence total 200 points.

  Me and one other guy who was selected had ~120 points.

  It is not clear how many people were selected after this step, but I think the selection criteria was somewhere between 75-80 points(not sure).

  The problems alone were not that tough, but the time limit was 90 minutes, which made the test somewhat challenging.

I got the mail for that they'll be scheduling an interview about 2 weeks later. 
The first round of the interviews was around 10 days after that in February 2021 IIRC.

<h3> First Round of Interviews </h3>

I was having my night's sleep on one fine afternoon when I recieved a mail around 12 Noon that my interview is scheduled at 3:00 PM the same day.

I woke up at 3:00 to have lunch and plans to go back to bed again when I read the mail. I was shit scared.
Then I mailed the <em>HR</em> to re-schedule the interview if possible, luckily they considered my request and re-scheduled it the same day in evening.


<br>
The interview was scheduled for only 30 minutes and I was pretty confused what will they ask in only 30 minutes. 
<br>
When I entered the zoom call there were 2 interviewers, they introduced them and then I proceeded with my introduction.

The first problem was as follows:
<br> <br> <br>
<em>You have been given a 2D array, some random location in it(the coordinates) and the address of the element at 0, 0 in memory. Find the address of elements at given coordinates.</em>
<br><br>
I solved it shortly but due to nervousness and lack of proper sleep, I couldn't initially remember what is the exact size of an integer in memory (4 or 8 bytes).
<br><br><br>

The second problem was a version of <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/">this popular problem</a>.

<br>
I cant exactly recall the problem, but it was pretty similar to this one. Just a little tweaked. <br>
I first proceeded to explain my approach, then they asked me to code it and ran it on a few test cases. It was a simple problem, hence there were no issues solving it.
<br><br>

Then they asked me a few questions related to one of my projects, backend related stuff. 
<br><br>

We had casual conversation for a few minutes then the interview ended.
<br><br>
<h3> Second Round of Interviews </h3>
<aside>Will be adding the second part very soon, stay tuned</aside>
